# TrackAI — Unofficial Formula 1 Strategy & Prediction Research Platform

TrackAI is a **research-oriented software project** focused on **Formula 1 race visualization, strategy analysis, and probabilistic prediction using AI and machine learning**.

The goal of TrackAI is to build a **modular, versioned analytics platform** that evolves from a basic race replay system (MVP) into an advanced **AI-driven strategy and prediction engine**.

This repository is structured to support **academic use, research documentation, and open-source learning**.
